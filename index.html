      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

      <img src="images/bike.jpg" width="250px" height="250px" alt="Colbert Tse">

      <p>My name is Colbert Tse, and I am a Bay Area Native who calls San Francisco my home.  Having always been facinated by technology and computers, I am taking <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development/san-francisco">FEWD</a>, <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/san-francisco‎">General Assembly's</a> course on Front End Web Design to learn and build upon my knowledge working with the web.  In addition to working with technology, I am a foodie who is fond of the great food scene that the Bay Area has to offer.  One of my favorite places is <a href="http://www.lersros.com">Lers Ros</a> for Thai food.  Also, I enjoy biking in San Francisco to get around town and being active in the bicycle scene as a member of the <a href="http://www.sfbike.org">San Francisco Bicycle Coalition</a>.  Also, I enjoy music a lot whether it is going to concerts at great venues like the <a href="http://www.thefillmore.com">Fillmore</a> to joy of listening to music on vinyl.</p>

      <p>I look forward to expanding my basic skills in HTML to advancing them as I learn HTML 5, CSS, and Javascript, the fundamentals of Front-End Web Development.</p>
